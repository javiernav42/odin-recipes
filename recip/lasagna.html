                    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                        Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                        Drain and discard grease. 
                        Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. 
                        Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.
                    </li>

                    <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. 
                        Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
                    </li>    

                    <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. 
                        Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
                    </li>

                    <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
                    </li>

                    <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.
                    </li>
